# 📊 Univariate Analysis — Simple & Beautiful Notes

Welcome! 👋
This project focuses on **Univariate Analysis**, which means analyzing **one variable at a time** to understand its behavior, distribution, and key characteristics.

Think of it as getting to know your data before making big decisions 🧠✨

---

## 🔍 What is Univariate Analysis?

Univariate analysis is all about **exploring a single feature** in a dataset.

You usually ask questions like:
- What values does this variable take?
- How often do they appear?
- Is the data skewed?
- Are there outliers hiding somewhere? 👀

---

## 📦 Types of Univariate Analysis

### 🧮 Numerical Data
Used when the variable contains numbers.

Common techniques:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Variance & Standard Deviation
- Minimum & Maximum
- Percentiles

Visual tools 📈:
- Histogram
- Box Plot
- Density Plot

---

### 🏷️ Categorical Data
Used when the variable represents categories or labels.

Common techniques:
- Frequency count
- Percentage distribution

Visual tools 📊:
- Bar Chart
- Pie Chart 🥧

## 📈 Why Univariate Analysis Matters

✨ Helps you understand your data deeply
✨ Detects outliers early
✨ Guides feature engineering
✨ Builds strong foundations for multivariate analysis

Skipping this step is like coding without understanding the problem 😅
